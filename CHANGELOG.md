- add travis badge to the readme

### v2.3.0, 2015-02-12
- Improve fetching proper window_layout for zoomed windows. In order to fetch
  proper value, window has to get unzoomed. This is now done faster so that
  "unzoom,fetch value,zoom" cycle is almost unnoticable to the user.

### v2.2.0, 2015-02-12
- bugfix: zoomed windows related regression
- export save and restore script paths so that 'tmux-resurrect-save' plugin can
  use them
- enable "quiet" saving (used by 'tmux-resurrect-save' plugin)

### v2.1.0, 2015-02-12
- if restore is started when there's only **1 pane in the whole tmux server**,
  assume the users wants the "full restore" and overrwrite that pane.

### v2.0.0, 2015-02-10
- add link to the wiki page for "first pane/window issue" to the README as well
  as other tweaks
- save and restore grouped sessions (used with multi-monitor workflow)
- save and restore active and alternate windows in grouped sessions
- if there are no grouped sessions, do not output empty line to "last" file
- restore active and alternate windows only if they are present in the "last" file
- refactoring: prefer using variable with tab character
- remove deprecated `M-s` and `M-r` key bindings (breaking change)

### v1.5.0, 2014-11-09
- add support for restoring neovim sessions

### v1.4.0, 2014-10-25
- plugin now uses strategies when fetching pane full command. Implemented
  'default' strategy.
- save command strategy: 'pgrep'. It's here only if fallback is needed.
- save command strategy: 'gdb'
- rename default strategy name to 'ps'
- create `expect` script that can fully restore tmux environment
- fix default save command strategy `ps` command flags. Flags are different for
  FreeBSD.
- add bash history saving and restoring (@rburny)
- preserving layout of zoomed windows across restores (@Azrael3000)

### v1.3.0, 2014-09-20
- remove dependency on `pgrep` command. Use `ps` for fetching process names.

### v1.2.1, 2014-09-02
- tweak 'new_pane' creation strategy to fix #36
- when running multiple tmux server and for a large number of panes (120 +) when
  doing a restore, some panes might not be created. When that is the case also
  don't restore programs for those panes.

### v1.2.0, 2014-09-01
- new feature: inline strategies when restoring a program

### v1.1.0, 2014-08-31

- show spinner during the save process
- add screencast script
- make default program running list even more conservative

### v0.4.0, 2014-08-29
- change plugin name to `tmux-resurrect`. Change all the variable names.

### v0.3.0, 2014-08-29
- bugfix: when top is running the pane `$PWD` can't be saved. This was causing
  issues during the restore and is now fixed.
- restoring sessions multiple times messes up the whole environment - new panes
  are all around. This is now fixed - pane restorations are now idempotent.
- if pane exists from before session restore - do not restore the process within
  it. This makes the restoration process even more idempotent.
- more panes within a window can now be restored
- restore window zoom state

### v0.2.0, 2014-08-29
- bugfix: with vim 'session' strategy, if the session file does not exist - make
  sure vim does not contain `-S` flag

  processes that contain program name
